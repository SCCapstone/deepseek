# CalendarMedia (temp. name)
CalendarMedia is a sort of social web app designed to help users connect through shared events. Instead of focusing on posts and photos, like other more conventional social media, CalendarMedia centers around a user's calendars and their events. This allows the user to discover and share events that friends or nearby users are attending. With CalendarMedia, users can easily create and customize their own events and invite others to join in. The app features an interface where individuals can explore local happenings, from casual gatherings to community festivals. Users can also follow friends to stay updated on their activities. By prioritizing events over traditional social media content, CalendarMedia encourages real-world interactions and helps users make the most of their social lives.

### Development Environment

- **About**

    The dev environment uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
    to start a python server, javascript frontend, and mongodb database.
    It creates Docker containers and installs the required packages into
    those containers so that all developers will be using the same versions.

- **Setup**
1. Make sure to Install and start [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
        
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory

3. Run the command `docker-compose up`

4. To stop the environment press `Ctrl-C` in the terminal

5. To clean the environment run the command `docker system prune -af`

    - Do this to fix any environment issues or after changing package requirements
