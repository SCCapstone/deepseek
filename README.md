### Development Environment

- **About**

    The dev environment uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
    to start a python server, javascript frontend, and mongodb database.
    It creates Docker containers and installs the required packages into
    those containers so that all developers will be using the same versions.

- **Setup**
1. Install the docker thingy[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

2. Clone the repository and and navigate to the project directory

3. Run the command `docker-compose up`

4. To stop the environment press `Ctrl-C` in the terminal

5. To clean the environment run the command `docker system prune -af`

    - Do this to fix any environment issues or after changing package requirements
